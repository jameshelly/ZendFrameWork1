# Zend Framework Library

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a submodule for those wishing to use Zend Framework.
Stripped out all the usual things you get with a Zend Framework download.

I have added the following tags.

 *  ZF1.11.6
 *  ZF1.11.9
 *  ZF1.11.10

## Notes

As of the ZF1.11.10 tag I have added the [ZF Classmap Autoloader](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/262-Backported-ZF2-Autoloaders.html "Backported ZF2 Classmap Autoloader") to the ZendX folder.
